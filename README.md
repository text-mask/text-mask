Text Mask is an input mask library. It can create input masks for phone, date, currency, zip code, percentage, email, 
and literally anything!

There are convenient wrappers for React, Angular 2, Ember, and Vue. If you would like Text Mask to be available in another
framework or ecosystem, [email me](mailto:msafi@msafi.com)!
